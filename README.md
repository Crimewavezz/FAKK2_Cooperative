# **[Description]**
This project is a love letter to the game, and a attempt to bring cooperative gameplay into the Heavy Metal F.A.K.K. 2. Development is done by total beginner in coding, and whole project is used as a learning tool in various areas, so code may be at times confusing or illogical, but the end goal is always the same, to release a Co-Op mod with various QoL fixes.
